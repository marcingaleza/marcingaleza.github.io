    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I’m Marcin Gałęza, a seasoned Product Designer & UI Developer with over 20 years of experience crafting elegant, performant user interfaces. My background spans a wide range of digital products, with a strong emphasis on usability, scalability, and design consistency.</p>
    <p>In recent years, I’ve focused on developing and maintaining Design Systems using tools like React, Vue, Storybook, and TailwindCSS—bridging the gap between design and front-end engineering. I bring a deep UX mindset paired with the technical skills to bring ideas to life in code.</p>
    <p>I’m currently open to new opportunities in product-focused roles where I can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build and scale design systems</li>
      <li>Improve interface quality and accessibility</li>
      <li>Collaborate closely with designers and engineers</li>
      <li>Create seamless handoff between design and development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you’re looking for a hybrid designer-developer who values clarity, performance, and craft, I’d love to hear from you. <a href="mailto:marcin.galeza@gmail.com>Email me.</a></p>
